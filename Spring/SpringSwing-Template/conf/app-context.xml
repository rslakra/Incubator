	<!--
		The heart of a Spring project is the bean definition file (or files).
		This is an XML file that can have any name.
	-->
<!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC "-//SPRING//DTD BEAN//EN" 
          "http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans.dtd">

<beans>
	<!--
		The root element of the bean definition file is <beans>, which
		contains <bean> elements. The <bean> element provides several
		attributes, but for your first bean definition you'll use just three:
		id, class, and init-method. The id attribute defines the bean's name,
		which is used to retrieve it from Spring. The class attribute tells
		Spring which class to instantiate when it creates the bean. The
		init-method attribute defines a method name on the class that will be
		automatically invoked after Spring instantiates it. It is important to
		know that all beans are Singletons by default, unless you specify the
		singleton="false" attribute on the bean element. Spring automatically
		instantiates all Singletons when it is first initialized, unless the
		lazy-init="true" attribute is specified

	<bean id="mainFrame" class="com.examples.gui.MainFrame"
		init-method="init">
	</bean>
